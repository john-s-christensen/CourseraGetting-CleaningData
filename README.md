This Repo Contains:

-   An R script called 'run\_analysis.R' that contains all of the R commands I used to create the dataset 'MovementVarMeansBySubject&Activity'. This script is also well commented/documented in descibing what each command is doing.
-   A codebook, called 'CodeBook.md' that describes the data, variables and transformations I performed.
-   The .txt files I used to perform the analysis. Those files were downloaded here:
